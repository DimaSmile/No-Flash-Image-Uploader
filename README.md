No Flash Image Uploader
=======================

This Magento module allows the upload of product images and WYSIWYG media without having the Flash player installed. It has been removed from Magento Connect, so I retrieved it from a customer project and put it up on Github. It works on Magento 1.7, not sure about newer versions.

The extension is automatically enabled, i.e. there is no backend setting or configuration available.

Installation
------------

Just upload the app and js folders to your Magento installation or install via composer if you're a developer.
